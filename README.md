# Gold Badge Console Application Challenges

This project had me create 3 console applications from a list of prompts. I designed the applications using the Repository Design Pattern. Each application is comprised of three assemblies: one for the repository, one for the unit tests, and one for the console. I built the apps using the .NET framework (4.8).

## Three Challenges
1. The first challenge was about Komodo Cafe needing a new menu program. The cafe manager wanted a way to create and delete menu items and also view all existing items on the menu.
2. The second challenge was about Komodo Claims Department needing new code because its software wasn't functioning correctly. The claims manager wanted to be able to manage claims that were in a queue.
3. The third challenge was about Komodo Insurance having problems with their badging system.  They wanted me to use a dictionary collection so that an employee's badge ID could be tied to the doors that they have access to.
